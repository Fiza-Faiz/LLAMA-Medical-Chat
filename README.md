# LLAMA-Medical-Chat

LLAMA-Medical-Chat is a project focused on training a medical chatbot using LLAMA-2, a language model designed for medical applications.
This Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to train the LLAMA-2 model on Kaggle.

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook guides the user through the process of training a medical chatbot using the LLAMA-2 language model on Kaggle. LLAMA-2 is specifically designed for medical applications and enables the creation of a conversational agent capable of understanding and generating medical-related text.

## Key Steps

1. **Setup Environment:**
   - Import necessary libraries and set up the Kaggle environment.
   - Install required packages.

2. **Load Data:**
   - Load the medical training data to be used for training the chatbot.

3. **Preprocess Data:**
   - Perform data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
   - Tokenize and format the data appropriately for training.

4. **Tokenization:**
   - Tokenize the medical text data using LLAMA-2 tokenizer.

5. **Train LLAMA-2 Model:**
   - Train the LLAMA-2 language model on the preprocessed medical data.
   - Fine-tune the model for medical chatbot applications.

6. **Evaluate Model:**
   - Evaluate the performance of the trained model on a validation set.
   - Examine generated responses.

7. **Inference:**
   - Implement inference code for using the trained chatbot model to generate responses.

8. **Save Model:**
   - Save the trained LLAMA-2 model for future use.

## Getting Started

To get started with training the LLAMA-2 model, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fiza-Faiz/LLAMA-Medical-Chat.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd LLAMA-Medical-Chat
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Kaggle_Training_LLAMA2_Medical_Chat.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the LLAMA-2 model on Kaggle.

## Usage
